The *Taxi State Machine Diagram* shows how the `vehicle_state` and `event_type` relate to each other and how taxi vehicles can transition between states.

#### Trip State Notes

When there is only one trip ongoing, `trip_state == vehicle_state`

In cases where there are multiple trips ongoing, please follow the trip state model pseudocode for determining what the vehicle state should be:
```
t = all on-going trips for vehicle
v = vehicle state

if t.any(state == ‘stopped’):
v = ‘stopped’ 
else:
if t.any(state == ‘on_trip’):      
v = ‘on_trip’
else:
if t.any(state == ‘reserved’):
    v = ‘reserved’
```
`trip_state` mappings should be the same as in the table above.
