# Mobility Data Specification

In October of 2018, the City of Los Angeles implemented its first set of data specifications and data sharing requirements focused on dockless e-scooters and bicycles.

The Mobility Data Specification (MDS) helps the City ingest and analyze information from for-profit companies who operate dockless scooters and bicycles in the public right-of-way. MDS is a key piece of digital infrastructure that helps the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) understand how dockless mobility operates in Los Angeles, which then helps LADOT carry out its core responsibilities of safety, equity, and congestion relief.

Mobility providers are required to share data with LADOT as part of the City of Los Angeles&#39; Dockless Mobility Permit. Standardizing data collection between different providers improves cooperation, innovation, and efficiency of the City&#39;s transportation network.

**MDS Components** 

* The [`provider`][provider] Application Program Interface (API) was created in May 2018 to be implemented by mobility providers. When a municipality queries information from a mobility provider, the Provider API automatically generates a historical view of operations in a standard format.

* The [`agency`][agency] API was created in April 2019 to be implemented by regulatory agencies. Providers query the Agency API when an event occurs, like a trip starting or ending.

Regulators can choose best how to implement *Agency* and *Provider* either separately, concurrently, or by endpoint. 

**How MDS is used in Los Angeles**

Information provided in MDS format enables LADOT:

- To verify how many scooters are operating
- To verify whether scooters are being deployed equitably across LA neighborhoods
- To determine whether scooters are dropped off outside of a service area
- To determine whether scooters are being parked in safe and appropriate parking areas
- To provide data validation for myla311 requests and complaints on dockless vehicles
- To inform future capital investments such as dockless vehicle drop zones or furniture zones
- To inform policy making â€“ number of scooters, distribution, etc.
- Develop ways to communicate dynamic information on unplanned events, such as emergency road closures, water main breaks, etc. to mobility providers to help them keep their users and contractors informed for better route planning and re-balancing efforts.
