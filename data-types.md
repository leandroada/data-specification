### Vehicle Types

The list of allowed `vehicle_type` values in MDS. Aligning with [GBFS vehicle types form factors](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md#vehicle_typesjson-added-in-v21-rc).

| `vehicle_type`   | Description |
|------------------| ----------- |
| `bicycle`        | A two-wheeled mobility device intended for personal transportation that can be operated via pedals, with or without a motorized assist (includes e-bikes, recumbents, and tandems) |
| `cargo_bicycle`  | A two- or three-wheeled bicycle intended for transporting larger, heavier cargo than a standard bicycle (such as goods or passengers), with or without motorized assist (includes bakfiets/front-loaders, cargo trikes, and long-tails) |
| `car`            | A passenger car or similar light-duty vehicle |
| `scooter`        | A standing or seated fully-motorized mobility device intended for one rider, capable of travel at low or moderate speeds, and suited for operation in infrastructure shared with motorized bicycles |
| `moped`          | A seated fully-motorized mobility device capable of travel at moderate or high speeds and suited for operation in general urban traffic |
| `delivery_robot` | A robot intended for transporting goods |
| `other`          | A device that does not fit in the other categories |

### Propulsion Types

| `propulsion`      | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `human`           | Pedal or foot propulsion                               |
| `electric_assist` | Provides power only alongside human propulsion         |
| `electric`        | Contains throttle mode with a battery-powered motor    |
| `combustion`      | Contains throttle mode with a gas engine-powered motor |

A vehicle may have one or more values from the `propulsion`, depending on the number of modes of operation. For example, a scooter that can be powered by foot or by electric motor would have the `propulsion` represented by the array `['human', 'electric']`. A bicycle with pedal-assist would have the `propulsion` represented by the array `['human', 'electric_assist']` if it can also be operated as a traditional bicycle.

## Vehicle Status 

A vehicle status record represents the current or last-known event and telemetry from a vehicle, defined as follows:

## Events

Events represent changes in vehicle status.

| Field | Type | Required/Optional | Comments |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------- | -------- |

| `event_geographies` | UUID[] | Optional | **[Beta feature](/general-information.md#beta-features):** *Yes (as of 2.0.0)*. Array of Geography UUIDs consisting of every Geography that contains the location of the status change. See [Geography Driven Events][geography-driven-events].

| `associated_ticket` | String | Optional | Identifier for an associated ticket inside an Agency-maintained 311 or CRM system |

### Event Times

Because of the unreliability of device clocks, the provider is unlikely to know with total confidence what time an event occurred at. However, providers are responsible for constructing as accurate a timeline as possible. Most importantly, the order of the timestamps for a particular device's events must reflect the provider's best understanding of the order in which those events occurred.

## Stops

Stops describe vehicle trip start and end locations in a pre-designated physical place. They can vary from docking stations with or without charging, corrals with lock-to railings, or suggested parking areas marked with spray paint. Stops are used in both [Provider](/provider#stops) and [Agency](/agency#stops) telemetry data.

### Data Notes

Report contents include every combination of special group types, geography IDs, and vehicle types in operation for each month since the provider began operations in the jurisdiction. New files are added monthly in addition to the previous monthly historic files. 

Counts are calculated based the agency's local time zone. Trips are counted based on their start time, i.e. if a trip starts in month A but ends in month B, it will be counted only as part of the report for month A. Similarly, trips are counted based on their start geography, i.e. if a trip starts in geography A and ends in geography B, it will appear in the counts for geography A and not for geography B.

All geography IDs included in the city published [Geography](/geography) API endpoint are included in the report results. In lieu of serving an API, this can alternately be a [flat file](/geography#file-format) created by the city and sent to the provider via link. If there is no `/geography` available, then counts are for the entire agency operating area, and `null` is returned for each Geography ID.

### Data Redaction

Some combinations of parameters may return a small count of trips, which could increase a privacy risk of re-identification. To correct for that, Reports does not return data below a certain count of results. This data redaction is called k-anonymity, and the threshold is set at a k-value of 10. For more explanation of this methodology, see our [Data Redaction Guidance document](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/MDS-Data-Redaction).

**If the query returns fewer than `10` trips in a count, then that row's count value is returned as "-1".** Note "0" values are also returned as "-1" since the goal is to group both low and no count values for privacy. 

This value may be adjusted in future releases and/or may become dynamic to account for specific categories of use cases and users. To improve the specification and to inform future guidance, users are encouraged to share their feedback and questions about k-values on this [discussion thread](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/discussions/622).

Using k-anonymity will reduce, but not necessarily eliminate the risk that an individual could be re-identified in a dataset, and this data should still be treated as sensitive. This is just one part of good privacy protection practices, which you can read more about in our [MDS Privacy Guide for Cities](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/main/documents/OMF-MDS-Privacy-Guide-for-Cities.pdf).

### Special Group Type	

Here are the possible values for the `special_group_type` dimension field:	

| Name             | Description                                                                                                           |	
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |	
| low_income       | Trips where a low income discount is applied by the provider, e.g., a discount from a qualified provider equity plan. |	
| adaptive_scooter | Trips taken on a scooter with features to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, e.g., scooter with a seat or wider base |
| all_riders       | All riders from any group                                                                                             |	

Other special group types may be added in future MDS releases as relevant agency and provider use cases are identified. When additional special group types or metrics are proposed, a thorough review of utility and relevance in program oversight, evaluation, and policy development should be done by OMF Working Groups, as well as any privacy implications by the OMF Privacy Committee.
