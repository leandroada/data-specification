# MDS Schema Definitions

Starting with MDS 2.0, schema validation of endpoints is done using [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) (instead of the former [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)).

See the external GitHub repository called [`mds-openapi`](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mds-openapi) for more details and definitions, and browse the interactive API documentation on our [MDS Stoplight workspace](https://openmobilityfnd.stoplight.io/docs/mobility-data-specification/branches/main).
